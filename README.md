# hello-world
This is my first respository

Hey pro´s :) I startet to code 2 years ago with simple HTML5 & css in school,
but then I made the MS Office advanced and stopped coding. Now I´m back and I will
get my final grade soon. For that I have to design a website with some php.

I have got a great creativity and I imagine a lot but I´m worried because I can't create what I´m "fantasysing"...

Because of all my great ideas I´m not sure what I want to create yet.

But I have to start because I it has to be finoshed by the end of the month.
So will start to build a nice navigation - including a responsive webdisegn, and then move on wgile leariningfrom videos.

It wouldbe great if anyone could tell me some great resources. I´m looking for great libraries with cool codes - it´s important for me to see the result before, because it is so hard for me to decide, because I'm a little perfectionist.

So thank you for your help, I will post my project and hope to get some great tipps.

Happy coding to all of you, all the best & Beste  Grüße from Vienna,
Niinchen
